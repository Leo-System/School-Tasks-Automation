# School-Tasks-Automation

##In Progress.

This is a code that automate school homework. It is made using python and PyAutoGui. Note that it uses the setup of my computer to work (that is a arch Linux with i3wm with no customization in the window layout), so have in mind that it is made to work in my computer.
